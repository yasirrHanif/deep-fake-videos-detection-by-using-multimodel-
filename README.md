# Deepfake Detection System Using Multimodal Approaches

## Project Overview
In an era of digital content creation, deepfakes have emerged as a critical threat, challenging the authenticity of video materials. This project aims to develop a sophisticated deepfake detection system leveraging multimodal approaches. By integrating various sources of information—such as audio, video, and metadata—our system seeks to enhance detection accuracy and robustness against the evolving techniques used in creating deepfakes.

## Objectives
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Utilize both visual and auditory features for effective detection.
- **Enhanced Accuracy:** Minimize false positives and negatives through advanced machine learning algorithms.
- **Real-time Processing:** Aim for efficient processing to facilitate real-time detection in various applications, including social media platforms and news broadcasting.

## Features
- **Multimodal Input Processing:** Capability to analyze video frames, audio tracks, and contextual data.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of various models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for audio processing.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Providing a simple interface for users to upload videos for analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Flask
- **Other Tools:** OpenCV for computer vision tasks, Librosa for audio analysis.

## Future Work
This project is continuously evolving. Future enhancements may include:
- Integration with blockchain technology for authenticity verification.
- Collaboration with AI ethicists to address the implications of deepfake technology.

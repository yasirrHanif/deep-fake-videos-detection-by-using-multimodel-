# Deep Fake Video Detection

## Overview
This project aims to develop a robust system for detecting deep fake videos using multimodal approaches. Deep fakes pose a significant threat to the authenticity of video content, and this project seeks to provide a reliable detection mechanism.

## Objectives
- To analyze the existing techniques for deep fake detection.
- To implement multimodal models that leverage both visual and audio information.
- To evaluate the performance of the models against benchmarks and real-world data.

## Key Components
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering a diverse dataset of deep fake and real videos.
2. **Preprocessing**: Steps to prepare the videos for model training, including normalization and augmentation.
3. **Model Development**: Using machine learning and deep learning algorithms to build detection models.
4. **Evaluation**: Testing the models on unseen data and comparing their performance metrics.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yasirrHanif/deep-fake-videos-detection-by-using-multimodel-
    ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
